# Multiplatter - Recipe Sharing

## Project Description:

Our primary purpose is to let people access one place where they can find everything they
would need to cook their favorite dishes or even try to make new dishes. The recipes, the
ingredients needed, substitutes, best places they can buy items required in the recipe, reviews
about the recipe including other people’s experiences with it. People can look for recipes based
on the ingredients they have, cuisine preferences and dietary and time restrictions. Another use
can be looking for the best nearby place to buy missing items. They can also rate and view
other people’s reviews of a particular recipe
